Definition: A Bitcoin Recovery service purports to be able to recover lost or stolen cryptocurrency. There are first consultation fees charged. Then more deppsits needed for claimed asset recovery. Then comes requested depposits beyond the client ability to do. And when asked for, there are no refunds. Agents may send emails, call on the phone and use Whatsapp to request deposits.
There does not appear to be any remedy for this. It is upon you to publish known scam sites and show their addresses.
Below is a list of lost Bitcoin to recovery service incidents by company name.
Bitcoinsrecoverytool.com - The requested service was to recover lost Coinoryx Bitcoin. You may view the by now compromised wallet that the agent has the seed and used to take away Bitcoin. bc1qr4aa8ylzumpx57k0x6rf48qhj95uc6vz4z3ydt Please use Blockchair to view transaction history since July 25, 2022. Nearly all but one outgoing transaction went to Bitcoinsrecoverytool.com agent. (And that one exception was software purchoased but no product delivered by another service.) Initial fees were on 7/25 through 7/26. Then a new request for more sent on 8/01. The next request for more deposits were from 8/3 to 8/4 to collect and send to wallet then the payment on 8/11. But that was just to start the service. Then there was a request for 10K in Euros. (About $10,500 at the time.) An IRA was cashed out and it took more than a week to complete deposits to reach 10K. The agent script grabbed the 0.52294954 BTC automatcially and it was gone in minutes. It went to pay for a "bridge". That was not the end! Next, agent wanted $900 to buy his software. On 9/23 after purchase of software, the servie was installation of free Atomic Wallet. After that 25K in Ethereum was requested, which was not possible. No amount of arguing with agent had any effect. It was not possible to get BTC on a Friday night. From the rich wallet list I saw, I guessed that the project was agent project to access a rich wallet. This was time to end, bearing in mind that agent also very rudely logged into bank account while using AnyDesk to install Atomic Wallet. Whatsapp session ended and blocked. Returned a month later to inform agent of federal tax lien and made a request for return of now taxed assets. It had no effect. This is a technical puzzle for you to solve. What can you do to make this right?
Dark Tracer Digital - This one requested 0.3 BTC which appeared be all that was needed to recover lost Coinoryx wallet Bitcoin. You may view the escrow address to see transaction history. 19b8opXc1yAX2Vyvaf8nRgdqFD9YHpPnhr (CashCrow) Then the agent requested 0.7 BTC. But that was not possible to do financially safely. No amount of argument and reason had any effect. To this day Dark Tracer keeps asking for deposits. So 0.3 BTC has been lost.
Clawback - Starting June 2021, goal was to recovery Doubly LTD and PolarInvestent wallet deposits. Coinoryx was the escrow account. All deposits were completed by end of December. (See wallet address bc1qr4aa8ylzumpx57k0x6rf48qhj95uc6vz4z3ydt from 6/18 to 12/29.) After completion of deposits, you can see that it went to wallet [dde7d72696]. Then it split into two parts. But both went to wallet [922748b543]. Then it went to wallet [0000144822]. It is an active wallet with current balance (2023-03-23 18:58:10) of 709.05183686 BTC. But all through 2022, there was no receipt of any recovered funds. The website was closed Feb/March. Then on January 1, 2023, I received an email that claimed that the recovered BTC was in a Trezor wallet ready to be shipped. It had $500K in BTC the email claimed. I just had to pay a shipping fee. The name of the shipping website was AlliedXpress, an apparent clone of the India website. It has login and a profile page. When the Trezor wallet was presumably shipped, the website tracking reported a path from Sussex, UK to Heathrow, UK. Then to France. Then it traveled to Lisbon. But then on January 9th, the website tracking reported that the Trezor wallet was seized due to its value with a fine imposed. The Clawback agent agreed to pay half of 2% of the fine. ($5K in USDT spent to release the Trezor wallet.) The item apparently then ended up in Newark, New Jersey airport. But after that there was no service or response about what to do next. How does it go from NJ to my state? But days and then weeks went by. After confirming that the shipping website was phishing because the real Austrialian contact did not recognize it. UK does not have an AlliedXpress company. So did the Clawback agent fall for a phishing scam? None of this makes any sense of course. Real shipping sites don't track by airport but by the shipping bar code. January was indeed a bit of a nightmare because of this very odd experience and it cost me the rest of my security assets. I trusted Clawback in 2021, but in 2023, it was such an odd reality check trip to take. Why would anyone do that? I am low income but blessed with inherited funds from 2018 used up through 2023. I'd be happy with 1 BTC to fix everything, back to what it was in 2019 when it all started.
Summmary: This reccovery of lost cryptocurrency assets industry needs to change. No one should have to pay any fees if scammed. If you are skilled with generating assets easily with investments, sales or other methods, it should not be hard to repair wallets when asked.
